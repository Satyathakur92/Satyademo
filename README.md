# Math Solvers AI

A collection of intelligent solvers built using traditional techniques and AI/ML approaches to tackle problems in vector calculus, differential equations, and symbolic integration. Ideal for engineers, students, and data enthusiasts!

## 🔍 Features
- Vector calculus solver for gradients, curls, and divergences.
- Differential equation solvers using numerical methods and symbolic engines.
- Symbolic integration using SymPy and custom logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, SymPy, SciPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Optional: Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for future ML integrations

## 🚀 Setup
1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-solvers-ai.git`
2. Navigate to the folder  
   `cd math-solvers-ai`
3. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🤖 Future Plans
- Add a Streamlit interface for interactive equation solving
- Integrate basic ML models for pattern recognition in symbolic expressions
- Host notebooks with Binder
